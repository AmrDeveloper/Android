<!-- Typed array resources are used to created a list of static data
in this case, we can list the types of plants here and use string resources when displaying them
to allow translation. Each item is indexed in the array based on its order starting from 0 -->

<!-- To access this array in the code
Resources res = getResources();
TypedArray plantTypes = res.obtainTypedArray(R.array.plant_types);
String type = plantTypes.getString(0); // this will return "vine"
-->

<!-- To add a new type simple insert a new item tag below then make sure you have added the following resources:
 1. A string resource in strings.xml with the display name for the new type and the key being the item value below
 2. An image resource for each of the 3 phases of the plant with each having a normal, danger and dead mode:
    2.a. normal mode is simply the item name below followed by the age phase (e.g. cactus_1, cactus_2, etc..)
    2.b. danger mode is the item name followed by "_danger" then the age phase (e.d. cactus_danger_1, etc..)
    2.c. dead is the same as danger but with the suffix "_dead" then the age phase (e.d. cactus_dead_1, etc..)
